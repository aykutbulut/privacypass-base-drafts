# Introduction

Privacy Pass is an architecture for authorization based on anonymous-credential
authentication mechanisms. Typical approaches for authorizing clients,
such as through the use of long-term cookies, are not privacy-friendly
since they allow servers to track clients across sessions and interactions.
Privacy Pass takes a different approach: instead of presenting linkable
state carrying information to servers, e.g., a cookie indicating whether
or not the client is an authorized user or has completed some prior
challenge, clients present unlinkable proofs that attest to this information.
These proofs, or tokens, are anonymous in the sense that a given token cannot
be linked to the protocol instance in which that token was initially issued.

At a high level, the Privacy Pass architecture consists of two protocols:
issuance and redemption. The issuance protocol runs between an endpoint referred
to as a Client and two functions in the Privacy Pass architecture:
Attestation and Issuance. These two network functions can be implemented by the
same protocol participant, but can also be implemented separately. The entity
that implements Issuance, referred to as the Issuer, is responsible for issuing
tokens in response to requests from Clients. The entity that implements
Attestation, referred to as the Attester, is responsible for attesting to
properties about the Client for which tokens are issued. The Issuer needs to be
trusted by the server that later redeems the token. Attestation can be
performed by the Issuer or by an Attester that is trusted by the Issuer.
Clients might prefer to select different Attesters, separate from the Issuer,
to be able to use preferred authentication methods or to improve privacy by not
directly communicating with an Issuer. Depending on the attestation,
Attesters can store state about a Client, such as the number of overall tokens
issued thus far. As an example of an issuance protocol, in the original Privacy
Pass protocol {{PPSRV}}{{PPEXT}}, tokens were only issued to Clients that solved
CAPTCHAs. In this context, the Attester attested that some client solved a
CAPTCHA and the resulting token produced by the Issuer was proof of this fact.

The redemption protocol runs between Client and Origin (server). It allows
Origins to challenge Clients to present one or more tokens for authorization.
Depending on the type of token, e.g., whether or not it can be cached, the
Client either presents a previously obtained token or invokes the issuance
protocol to acquire one for authorization.

The issuance and redemption protocols operate in concert as shown in
the figure below.

{: #fig-overview title="Privacy Pass Architectural Components"}

This document describes requirements for both issuance and redemption
protocols. It also provides recommendations on how the architecture
should be deployed to ensure the privacy of clients and the security of
all participating entities.

The privacypass working group is working on
{{?AUTHSCHEME=I-D.ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme}} as an instantiation
of a redemption protocol and {{?ISSUANCE=I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol}} as an
instantiation of the issuance protocol.

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- Client: An entity that seeks authorization to an Origin.
- Origin: An entity that redeems tokens presented by Clients.
- Issuer: An entity that issues tokens to Clients for properties
  attested to by the Attester.
- Attester: An entity that attests to properties of Client for the
  purposes of token issuance.

# Architecture

The Privacy Pass architecture consists of four logical entities --
Client, Origin, Issuer, and Attester -- that work in concert as
shown in {{introduction}} for token issuance and redemption. This
section describes the purpose of token issuance and redemption
and the requirements therein on the relevant participants.

## Redemption Protocol

The redemption protocol is an authorization protocol wherein Clients present
tokens to Origins for authorization. Normally, redemption follows a
challenge-response flow, wherein the Origin challenges Clients for a token and,
if possible, Clients present a valid token for the challenge in response.
Alternatively, when configured to do so, Clients may opportunistically present
tokens to Origins without a corresponding challenge.

The context in which an Origin challenges a Client for a token is referred to
as the redemption context. This context includes all information associated
with the redemption event, such as the timestamp of the event, Client visible
information (including the IP address), and the Origin name.

The challenge controls the type of token that the Origin will accept for the
given resource. As described in
{{?AUTHSCHEME=I-D.ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme}}, there are a number of ways in
which the token may vary, including:

- Issuance protocol. The token identifies the type of issuance protocol
  required for producing the token. Different issuance protocols have different
  security properties, e.g., some issuance protocols may produce tokens that
  are publicly verifiable, whereas others may not have this property.
- Issuer identity. Tokens identify which Issuers are trusted for a given
  issuance protocol. Each Issuer, in turn, determines which Attesters it is
  willing to accept in the issuance protocol. This means that if an Origin
  origin.example accepts tokens issued by Issuer issuer.example, and that
  Issuer in turn accepts different types of attestation from more than one
  trusted Attester, then a Client may use either of these trusted Attesters
  to issue and redeem tokens for origin.example. However, origin.example neither
  explicitly specifies nor learns the Attesters or their attestation formats
  used for token issuance.
- Redemption context. Tokens can be bound to a given redemption context, which
  influences a client's ability to pre-fetch and cache tokens. For example,
  an empty redemption context always allows tokens to be issued and redeemed
  non-interactively, whereas a fresh and random redemption context means
  that the redeemed token must be issued only after the client receives the
  challenge. See Section 2.1.1 of {{AUTHSCHEME}} for more details.
- Per-Origin or cross-Origin. Tokens can be constrained to the Origin for
  which the challenge originated (referred to as per-Origin tokens), or
  can be used across multiple Origins (referred to as cross-Origin tokens).
  The set of Origins for which a cross-Origin token is applicable is referred
  to as the cross-Origin set.

Origins that admit cross-Origin tokens bear some risk of allowing tokens
issued for one Origin to be spent in an interaction with another Origin.
In particular, depending on the use case, Origins may need to maintain
state to track redeemed tokens. For example, Origins that accept cross-Origin
tokens across shared redemption contexts SHOULD track which tokens have been
redeemed already in those redemption contexts, since these tokens can
be issued and then spent multiple times in response to any such challenge.
See Section 2.1.1 of {{AUTHSCHEME}} for discussion.

## Issuance Protocol

The issuance protocol embodies the core of Privacy Pass. It takes as input
a challenge from the redemption protocol and produces a token, as shown
in the figure below.

~~~
  Origin          Client        Attester          Issuer

                  +--------------------------------------\
    Challenge ----> Attest ------->                      |
                  | TokenRequest ------------------>     |
                  |                            (validate)|
                  |                            (evaluate)|
      Token  <----+  <-------------------  TokenResponse |
                  |--------------------------------------/
~~~
{: #fig-issuance title="Issuance Overview"}

Clients interact with the Attester and Issuer to produce a token in response to
a challenge. The context in which an Attester vouches for a Client during
issuance is referred to as the attestation context. This context includes all
information associated with the issuance event, such as the timestamp of the
event and Client visible information, including the IP address or other
information specific to the type of attestation done.

Each issuance protocol may be different, e.g., in the number and types of
participants, underlying cryptographic constructions used when issuing tokens,
and even privacy properties.

Clients initiate the issuance protocol using the challenge, a randomly
generated nonce, and public key for the Issuer, all of which are the Client's
private input to the protocol and ultimately bound to an output Token;
see Section 2.2. of {{AUTHSCHEME}} for details. Future specifications
may change or extend the Client's input to the issuance protocol to produce
Tokens with a different structure.

The issuance protocol itself can be any interactive protocol between Client,
Issuer, or other parties that produces a valid authenticator over the Client's
private input, subject to the following security requirements.

1. Unconditional input secrecy. The issuance protocol MUST NOT reveal anything
about the Client's private input, including the challenge and nonce, to the
Attester or Issuer, regardless of the hardness assumptions of the underlying
cryptographic protocol(s). The issuance protocol can reveal the Issuer public
key for the purposes of determining which private key to use in producing the
token.
1. One-more forgery security. The issuance protocol MUST NOT allow malicious
Clients or Attesters (acting as Clients) to forge tokens offline or otherwise
without interacting with the Issuer directly.
1. Concurrent security. The issuance protocol MUST be safe to run concurrently
with arbitrarily many Clients, Attesters and Issuers.

See {{extensions}} for requirements on new issuance protocol variants and
related extensions.

Clients obtain the Issuer public key directly from the Origin using the process
described in {{AUTHSCHEME}}. Clients MAY apply some form of key
consistency check to determine if this public key is consistent and correct for
the specified Issuer. See {{?CONSISTENCY=I-D.wood-key-consistency}} for example
mechanisms. Depending on the deployment, the Attester might assist the Client
in applying these consistency checks across clients.

Depending on the use case, issuance may require some form of Client
anonymization service, similar to an IP-hiding proxy, so that Issuers cannot
learn information about Clients. This can be provided by an explicit
participant in the issuance protocol, or it can be provided via external means,
such as through the use of an IP-hiding proxy service like Tor. In general,
Clients SHOULD minimize or remove identifying information where possible when
invoking the issuance protocol.

Issuers MUST NOT issue tokens for Clients through untrusted Attesters. This is
important because the Attester's role is to vouch for trust in
privacy-sensitive Client information, such as account identifiers or IP address
information, to the Issuer. Tokens produced by an Issuer that admits issuance
for any type of attestation cannot be relied on for any specific property.
See {{attester-role}} for more details.

### Attester Role

Attestation is an important part of the issuance protocol. Attestation is the
process by which an Attester bears witness to, confirms, or authenticates a
Client so as to verify a property about the Client that is required for
Issuance. Examples of attestation properties include, though are not limited
to:

- Capable of solving a CAPTCHA. Clients that solve CAPTCHA challenges can be
  attested to have this capability for the purpose of being ruled out as a bot
  or otherwise automated Client.
- Client state. Clients can be associated with state and the attester can
  attest to this state. Examples of state include the number of issuance
  protocol invocations, the Client's geographic region, and whether the
  client has a valid application-layer account.
- Trusted device. Some Clients run on trusted hardware that are capable of
  producing device-level attestation statements.

Each of these attestation types has different security properties. For example,
attesting to having a valid account is different from attesting to running on
trusted hardware. In general, minimizing the set of attestation formats helps
minimize the amount of information leaked through a token.

Each attestation format also has an impact on the overall system privacy.
Requiring a conjunction of attestation types could decrease the overall
anonymity set size. For example, the number of Clients that have solved a
CAPTCHA in the past day, that have a valid account, and that are running on a
trusted device is less than the number of Clients that have solved a CAPTCHA in
the past day. Attesters SHOULD not admit attestation types that result in small
anonymity sets.

The trustworthiness of attesters depends on their ability to correctly and
reliably perform attestation during the issuance protocol. However, certain
types of attestation can vary in value over time, e.g., if the attestation
process is compromised or maliciously automated. These are considered
exceptional events and require configuration changes to address the underlying
cause. For example, if attestation is compromised because of a zero-day exploit
on compliant devices, then the corresponding attestation format should be
untrusted until the exploit is patched. Addressing changes in attestation
quality is therefore a deployment-specific task. In Split Attester and Issuer
deployments (see {{deploy-split}}), Issuers can choose to remove compromised
Attesters from their trusted set until the compromise is patched.

### Issuer Role

Issuers MUST be uniquely identifiable by all Clients with a consistent
identifier. In a web context, this identifier might be the Issuer host name. As
discussed in {{privacy}}, ecosystems that admit a large number of Issuers can
lead to privacy concerns for the Clients in the ecosystem. Therefore, in
practice, the number of Issuers should be bounded. The actual Issuers can be
replaced with different Issuers as long as the total never exceeds these
bounds. Moreover, Issuer replacements also have an effect on client anonymity
that is similar to when a key rotation occurs. See {{privacy}} for more details
about maintaining privacy with multiple Issuers.

#### Key Management

Issuers maintain an issuance key pair for the issuance protocol.
The Issuer public key is made available to all Clients in such
a way that key rotations and other updates are publicly visible.
See {{key-rotation-privacy}} for more considerations around
Issuer key rotation. The key material and protocol configuration
that an Issuer uses to produce tokens corresponds to two different
pieces of information.

- The issuance protocol in use; and
- The public keys that are active for the Issuer.

The way that the Issuer publishes and maintains this information impacts
the effective privacy of the clients; see {{privacy}} for more details.
The fundamental requirement for key management and discovery is that Issuers
cannot target specific clients with unique keys without detection. There
are a number of ways in which this might be implemented:

- Servers use a verifiable, tamper-free registry from which clients discover
  keys. Similar to related mechanisms and protocols such as Certificate
  Transparency {{?RFC6962}}, this may require external auditors or additional
  client behavior to ensure the registry state is consistent for all clients.
- Clients use an anonymity-preserving tool such as Tor to discover keys
  from multiple network vantage points. This is done to ensure consistent
  keys to seemingly different clients.
- Clients embed Issuer keys into software.

As above, specific mechanisms for key management and discovery are out of scope
for this document.

### Metadata {#metadata}

Certain instantiations of the issuance protocol may permit public or private
metadata to be cryptographically bound to a token. As an example, one
trivial way to include public metadata is to assign a unique issuer
public key for each value of metadata, such that N keys yields log2(N)
bits of metadata. The total amount of metadata bits included in a token
is the sum of public and private metadata bits.

Public metadata is that which clients can observe as part of the token
issuance flow. Public metadata can either be transparent or opaque. For
example, transparent public metadata is a value that the client either
generates itself, or the Issuer provides during the issuance flow and
the client can check for correctness. Opaque public metadata is metadata
the client can see but cannot check for correctness. As an example, the
opaque public metadata might be a "fraud detection signal", computed on
behalf of the Issuer, during token issuance. In normal circumstances,
Clients cannot determine if this value is correct or otherwise a tracking
vector.

Private metadata is that which Clients cannot observe as part of the token
issuance flow. Such instantiations may be built on the Private Metadata Bit
construction from Kreuter et al. {{?KLOR20=DOI.10.1007/978-3-030-56784-2_11}}
or the attribute-based VOPRF from Huang et al. {{HIJK21}}.

Metadata may also be arbitrarily long or bounded in length. The amount of
permitted metadata may be determined by application or by the underlying
cryptographic protocol.

### Issuance Protocol Extensibility {#extensions}

The Privacy Pass architecture and ecosystem are both intended to be receptive
to extensions that expand the current set of functionalities through new
issuance protocols. Each issuance protocol MUST include a detailed analysis
of the privacy impacts of the extension, why these impacts are justified,
and guidelines on how to deploy the protocol to minimize any privacy impacts.
Any extension to the Privacy Pass protocol MUST adhere to the guidelines
specified in {{issuer-role}} for managing Issuer public key data.

# Deployment Considerations {#deployment}

A Client uses Privacy Pass to separate attestation context and redemption
context. Linking or combining these contexts can reveal sensitive information
about the Client, including their identity or browsing history. Depending on
the deployment model, separating these contexts can take different forms. The
Origin, Attester, and Issuer portrayed in {{fig-overview}} can be instantiated
and deployed in a number of ways. This section covers some expected deployment
models and their corresponding security and privacy considerations.

The discussion below assumes non-collusion between entities that have access to
the attestation context and entities that have access to the redemption
context, as collusion between such entities would enable linking of these
contexts. Generally, this means that entities operated by separate parties do
not collude. Mechanisms for enforcing non-collusion are out of scope for this
architecture.

## Shared Origin, Attester, Issuer {#deploy-shared}

In this model, the Origin, Attester, and Issuer are all operated by the same
entity, as shown in the figure below.

~~~
                   +------------------------------------------+
      Client       |  Attester         Issuer         Origin  |
        |          |                                          |
        |          |          Challenge                       |
        <----------------------------------------------+      |
        |          | Attest                                   |
        +----------------->                                   |
        |          |     TokenRequest                         |
        +-------------------------------->                    |
        |          |     TokenResponse                        |
        <--------------------------------+                    |
        |          |          Redeem                          |
        +---------------------------------------------->      |
                   +------------------------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-deploy-shared title="Shared Deployment Model"}

This model represents the initial deployment of Privacy Pass, as described in
{{PPSRV}}. In this model, the Attester, Issuer, and Origin share the
attestation and redemption contexts. As a result, attestation mechanisms that
can uniquely identify a Client, e.g., requiring that Clients authenticate with
some type of application-layer account, are not appropriate, as they could be
used to learn or reconstruct a Client's browsing history.

Attestation and redemption context unlinkability requires that these events be
separated over time, such as through the use of tokens with an empty redemption
context, or be separated over space, such as through the use of an anonymizing
proxy when connecting to the Origin.

## Joint Attester and Issuer {#deploy-joint-issuer}

In this model, the Attester and Issuer are operated by the same entity
that is separate from the Origin, as shown in the figure below.

~~~
                                                   +-----------+
      Client                                       |   Origin  |
        |                    Challenge             |           |
        <-----------------------------------------------+      |
        |                                          |           |

        |                    Redeem                |           |
        +----------------------------------------------->      |
                                                   |           |
                                                   +-----------+
~~~
{: #fig-deploy-joint-issuer title="Joint Attester and Issuer Deployment Model"}

This model is useful if an Origin wants to offload attestation and issuance to
a trusted entity. In this model, the Attester and Issuer share an attestation
context for the Client, which can be separate from the Origin's redemption
context.

For certain types of issuance protocols, this model separates attestation and
redemption contexts. However, issuance protocols that require the Issuer to
learn information about the Origin, such as that which is described in
{{?RATE-LIMITED=I-D.privacypass-rate-limit-tokens}}, are not appropriate since
they could link attestation and redemption contexts through the Origin name.

## Joint Origin and Issuer {#deploy-joint-origin}

In this model, the Origin and Issuer are operated by the same entity, separate
from the Attester, as shown in the figure below. The Issuer accepts token
requests that come from trusted Attesters. Depending on the issuance protocol,
the Attester may relay these requests between Client and Issuer over an
authenticated channel, or trust may be established in some other manner.

~~~

{: #fig-deploy-joint-origin title="Joint Origin and Issuer Deployment Model"}

This model is useful for Origins that require Client-identifying attestation,
e.g., through the use of application-layer account information, but do not
otherwise want to learn information about individual Clients beyond what is
observed during the token redemption, such as Client IP addresses.

In this model, attestation and redemption contexts are separate. As a result,
any type of attestation is suitable in this model. Moreover, any type of token
challenge is suitable assuming there is more than one Origin involved, since no
single party will have access to the identifying Client information and unique
Origin information. If there is only a single Origin, then per-Origin tokens
are not appropriate in this model, since the Attester can learn the redemption
context. However, the Attester does not learn whether a token is per-Origin or
cross-Origin.

## Split Origin, Attester, Issuer {#deploy-split}

In this model, the Origin, Attester, and Issuer are all operated by different
entities, as shown in the figure below. As with the joint Origin and Issuer
model, the Issuer accepts token requests that come from trusted Attesters, and
the details of that trust establishment depend on the issuance protocol.

{: #fig-deploy-split title="Split Deployment Model"}

This is the most general deployment model, and is necessary for some
types of issuance protocols where the Attester plays a role in token
issuance; see {{RATE-LIMITED}} for one such type of issuance protocol.
In this model, the Attester, Issuer, and Origin have a separate view
of the Client: the Attester sees potentially sensitive Client identifying
information, such as account identifiers or IP addresses, the Issuer
sees only the information necessary for issuance, and the Origin sees
token challenges, corresponding tokens, and Client source information,
such as their IP address. As a result, attestation and redemption contexts
are separate, and therefore any type of token challenge is suitable in
this model as long as there is more than a single Origin. As in the
Joint Origin and Issuer model in {{deploy-joint-origin}}, if there is
only a single Origin, then per-Origin tokens are not appropriate.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy}

A Client uses Privacy Pass to separate attestation context and redemption
context. Depending on the deployment model, this can take different forms.
For example, any Client can only remain private relative to the entire
space of other Clients using the protocol. Moreover, by owning tokens for
a given set of keys, the Client's anonymity set shrinks to the total number
of Clients controlling tokens for the same keys.

In the following, we consider the possible ways that Issuers can leverage their
position to try and reduce the size of the anonymity sets to which Clients
belong, often by segregating Clients. For each case, we provide mitigations
that the Privacy Pass ecosystem must implement to prevent these actions.

## Metadata Privacy Implications

Any metadata bits of information can be used to further segment the size
of the Client's anonymity set. Any Issuer that wanted to track a single
Client could add a single metadata bit to Client tokens. For the tracked
Client it would set the bit to `1`, and `0` otherwise. Adding additional
bits provides an exponential increase in tracking granularity similarly to
introducing more Issuers (though with more potential targeting).

For this reason, the amount of metadata used by an Issuer in creating
redemption tokens must be taken into account -- together with the bits
of information that Issuers may learn about Clients otherwise. Since this
metadata may be useful for practical deployments of Privacy Pass, Issuers
must balance this against the reduction in Client privacy. In general,
bounding the metadata permitted ensures that it cannot uniquely identify
individual Clients.

## Issuer Key Rotation {#key-rotation-privacy}

Issuer key rotation is important to hedge against long-term private key
compromise. If an Issuer realizes that a key compromise has occurred then the
Issuer should generate a new key and make it available to Clients. If
possible, it should invoke any revocation procedures that may apply for
the old key.

Key rotation can also be used to segment Client anonymity sets. In
particular, when an Issuer rotates their key, any Client that invokes the
issuance protocol in this key cycle will be part of a group of possible Clients
owning valid tokens for this key. To mechanize this attack strategy, an Issuer
could introduce a key rotation policy that forces Clients into small key
cycles, reducing the size of the anonymity set for these Clients.

In general, key rotations represent a trade-off between Client privacy and
Issuer security. Therefore, it is still important that key rotations occur on
a regular cycle to reduce the harmfulness of an Issuer key compromise. If there
are multiple Issuer keys in rotation, Clients can apply some form of
consistency mechanism {{CONSISTENCY}} to ensure that they receive the same key
as other Clients. Likewise, Origins can use one or more public keys for
redemption to support Issuer key rotation.

## Issuer Selection {#servers}

Similarly to the Issuer rotation dynamic discussed above, if there are a large
number of Issuers, and Origins accept all of them, segregation can occur. If
Clients obtain tokens from many Issuers, and Origins later challenge a Client
for a token from each Issuer, Origins can learn information about the Client.
Each per-Issuer token that a Client holds essentially corresponds to a bit of
information about the Client that Origin learns. Therefore, there is an
exponential loss in anonymity relative to the number of Issuers.

For example, if there are 32 Issuers, then Origins learn 32 bits of
information about the Client if a valid token is presented for each Issuer.
As a contrasting example, if Clients ensure that they only hold tokens issued
from 4 Issuers, then this increases the potential size of the anonymity sets
that the Client belongs to. However, this doesn't protect Clients
completely as it would if only 4 Issuers were permitted across the whole
system. For example, these 4 Issuers could be different for each Client.
Therefore, the selection of Issuers for which a Client possesses tokens is
still revealing. This trade-off is important in deciding the effective
anonymity of each Client in the system.

Clients SHOULD bound the number of Issuers they are willing to request tokens
from at any given time. The exact bound depends on the deployment model and
number of Clients, i.e., having a very large Client base could potentially
allow for larger values. Issuer replacements should only occur with the same
frequency as config rotations as they can lead to similar losses in
anonymity if clients still hold redemption tokens for previously active
Issuers.

Alternatively, when applicable, trusted registries can indicate which Issuers
are deemed to be active. If a Client is asked to invoke the issuance protocol
for an Issuer that is not declared active, then the client can refuse to run
the protocol and obtain a token.

Another option to allow a large number of Issuers in the ecosystem,
while preventing the joining of a number of different tokens, is for the
Client to maintain sharded "redemption partitions". This would allow the
Client to redeem the tokens it wishes to use in a particular context,
while still allowing the Client to maintain a large variety of tokens
from many Issuers. Within a redemption partition, the Client limits the
number of different Issuers used to a small number to maintain the
privacy properties the Client requires. As long as each redemption
partition maintains a strong privacy boundary with the others, the
number of bits of information the Origin can learn is bounded by the
number of "redemption partitions".

To support this strategy, the client keeps track of a `partition` which
contains the set of Issuers that redemptions have been attempted
against. An empty redemption is returned when the limit has been
hit:

~~~
  Client(partition, issuer)                     Issuer(skS, pkS)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  if issuer not in partition {
    if partition.length > REDEEM_LIMIT {
      Output {}
      return
    }
    partition.push(issuer)
  }
  token = store[issuer.id].pop()
  req = Redeem(token, info)

                               req
                        ------------------>

                               if (dsIdx.includes(req.data)) {
                                 raise ERR_DOUBLE_SPEND
                               }
                               resp = Verify(pkS, skS, req)
                               if resp.success {
                                 dsIdx.push(req.data)
                               }

                                resp
                        <------------------
  Output resp
~~~

## Side-Channel Attacks

Side-channel attacks, such as those based on timing correlation, could be
used to link attestation and redemption contexts together. In particular,
for interactive tokens that are bound to a Client-specific redemption
context, the anonymity set of Clients during the issuance protocol consists
of those Clients that started issuance between the time of the Origin's
challenge and the corresponding token redemption. Depending on the number
of Clients using a particular Issuer during that time window, the set can
be small. Appliations should take such side channels into consideration before
choosing a particular deployment model and type of token challenge and
redemption context.

# Centralization

A consequence of limiting the number of participants (Attesters or Issuers) in
Privacy Pass deployments for meaningful privacy is that it forces concentrated
centralization amongst those participants.
{{?CENTRALIZATION=I-D.nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization}} discusses
several ways in which this might be mitigated. For example, a multi-stakeholder
governance model could be established to determine what candidate participants
are fit to operate as participants in a Privacy Pass deployment. This is
precisely the system used to control the Web's trust model.

Alternatively, Privacy Pass deployments might mitigate this problem through
implementation. For example, rather than centralize the role of attestation
in one or few entities, attestation could be a distributed function performed
by a quorum of many parties, provided that neither Issuers nor Origins learn
which attester implementations were chosen. As a result, clients could have
more opportunities to switch between attestation participants.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Beyond the aforementioned security goals for the issuance protocol
({{issuance-protocol}}), it is important for Privacy Pass deployments to
mitigate the risk of abuse by malicious Origins.

For example, when a Client holds cross-Origin tokens for an Origin, it
is possible for any Origin in the cross-Origin set to deplete that Client
set of tokens. To prevent this from happening, tokens can be scoped to single
Origins such that they can only be redeemed for a single Origin.
Alternatively, if tokens are cross-Origin, Clients can use alternate methods
to prevent many tokens from being redeemed at once. For example,
if the Origin requests an excess of tokens, the Client could choose to
not present any tokens for verification if a redemption had already
occurred in a given time window.
