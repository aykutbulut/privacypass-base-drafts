This document specifies two variants of the two-message issuance protocol
for Privacy Pass tokens: one that produces tokens that are privately
verifiable using the issuance private key, and another that produces tokens
that are publicly verifiable using the issuance public key.

# Introduction

The Privacy Pass protocol provides a privacy-preserving authorization
mechanism. In essence, the protocol allows clients to provide cryptographic
tokens that prove nothing other than that they have been created by a given
server in the past {{?ARCHITECTURE=I-D.ietf-privacypass-architecture}}.

This document describes the issuance protocol for Privacy Pass built on
{{?HTTP=RFC9110}}. It specifies two variants: one that is privately verifiable
using the issuance private key based on the oblivious pseudorandom function from
{{!OPRF=I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}, and one that is publicly verifiable using the
issuance public key based on the blind RSA signature scheme
{{!BLINDRSA=I-D.irtf-cfrg-rsa-blind-signatures}}.

This document does not cover the Privacy Pass architecture, including
choices that are necessary for deployment and application specific choices
for protecting client privacy. This information is covered in {{ARCHITECTURE}}.

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- Client: An entity that runs the Issuance protocol with an Issuer to produce
  Tokens that can be later used for redemption (see
  {{Section 2.2 of !AUTHSCHEME=I-D.ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme}}).
- Issuer: A service that provides Tokens to Clients.
- Issuer Public Key: The public key (from a private-public key pair) used by
  the Issuer for issuing and verifying Tokens.
- Issuer Private Key: The private key (from a private-public key pair) used by
  the Issuer for issuing and verifying Tokens.

This document additionally uses the terms "Origin" and "Token" as defined in
{{ARCHITECTURE}}.

Unless otherwise specified, this document encodes protocol messages in TLS
notation from {{Section 3 of !TLS13=RFC8446}}. Moreover, all constants are in
network byte order.

# Protocol Overview

The issuance protocols defined in this document embody the core of Privacy Pass.
Clients receive TokenChallenge inputs from the redemption protocol
({{AUTHSCHEME, Section 2.1}}) and use the issuance protocols to produce
corresponding Token values ({{AUTHSCHEME, Section 2.2}}). The issuance protocol
describes how Clients and Issuers interact to compute a token using a one-round
protocol consisting of a TokenRequest from the Client and TokenResponse from
the Issuer. This interaction is shown below.

~~~ aasvg
  Origin             Client        Attester          Issuer

                    +-------------------------------------.
  TokenChallenge ---> Attest ------->                      |
                    | TokenRequest ------------------>     |
                    |                            (evaluate)|
      Token  <------+  <-------------------  TokenResponse |
                     `------------------------------------'
~~~
{: #fig-issuance title="Issuance Overview"}

The TokenChallenge inputs to the issuance protocols described in this
document can be interactive or non-interactive, and per-origin or cross-origin.

The issuance protocols defined in this document are compatible with any
deployment model defined in {{Section 4 of ARCHITECTURE}}. The details of
attestation are outside the scope of the issuance protocol; see
{{Section 4 of ARCHITECTURE}} for information about how attestation can
be implemented in each of the relevant deployment models.

This document describes two variants of the issuance protocol: one that is
privately verifiable ({{private-flow}}) using the issuance private key based on
the oblivious pseudorandom function from {{!OPRF=I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}, and one
that is publicly verifiable ({{public-flow}}) using the issuance public key
based on the blind RSA signature scheme
{{!BLINDRSA=I-D.irtf-cfrg-rsa-blind-signatures}}.

# Configuration {#setup}

Issuers MUST provide two parameters for configuration:

1. Issuer Request URL: A token request URL for generating access tokens.
   For example, an Issuer URL might be
   https://issuer.example.net/request.
2. Issuer Public Key values: A list of Issuer Public Keys for the issuance
   protocol.

The Issuer parameters can be obtained from an Issuer via a directory object,
which is a JSON object ({{!RFC8259, Section 4}}) whose values are other JSON
values ({{RFC8259, Section 3}}) for the parameters. The contents of this JSON
object are defined in {{directory-values}}.

| Field Name           | Value                                                  |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| issuer-request-uri   | Issuer Request URL value (as an absolute or relative URL) as a percent-encoded URL string, represented as a JSON string ({{RFC8259, Section 7}}) |
| token-keys           | List of Issuer Public Key values, each represented as JSON objects ({{RFC8259, Section 4}}) |
{: #directory-values title="Issuer directory object description"}

Each "token-keys" JSON object contains the fields and corresponding raw values
defined in {{tokenkeys-values}}.

| Field Name   | Value                                                  |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| token-type   | Integer value of the Token Type, as defined in {{token-type}}, represented as a JSON number ({{RFC8259, Section 6}}) |
| token-key    | The base64url encoding of the Public Key for use with the issuance protocol, including padding, represented as a JSON string ({{RFC8259, Section 7}}) |
{: #tokenkeys-values title="Issuer 'token-keys' object description'"}

Issuers MAY advertise multiple token-keys for the same token-type to
support key rotation. In this case, Issuers indicate preference for which
token key to use based on the order of keys in the list, with preference
given to keys earlier in the list.

Altogether, the Issuer's directory could look like:

~~~
 {
    "issuer-request-uri": "https://issuer.example.net/request",
    "token-keys": [
      {
        "token-type": 2,
        "token-key": "MI...AB",
      },
      {
        "token-type": 2,
        "token-key": "MI...AQ",
      }
    ]
 }
~~~

Issuer directory resources have the media type
"application/token-issuer-directory" and are located at the well-known location
/.well-known/token-issuer-directory; see {{wkuri-reg}} for the registration
information for this well-known URI.

Issuers SHOULD use HTTP caching to permit caching of this resource
{{!RFC5861}}. The cache lifetime depends on the Issuer's key rotation schedule.
Regular rotation of token keys is recommended to minimize the risk of key
compromise.

Issuers can control cache lifetime with the Cache-Control header, as follows:

~~~
  Cache-Control: max-age=86400
~~~

Consumers of the Issuer directory resource SHOULD follow the usual HTTP caching
{{!RFC9111}} semantics when processing this resource. Long cache lifetimes may
result in use of stale Issuer configuration information, whereas short
lifetimes may result in decreased performance. When use of an Issuer
configuration results in token issuance failures, e.g., because the
configuration information is too stale, the directory SHOULD be fetched and
revalidated.

# Issuance Protocol for Privately Verifiable Tokens {#private-flow}

The privately verifiable issuance protocol allows Clients to produce Token
values that verify using the Issuer Private Key. This protocol is based
on the oblivious pseudorandom function from {{!OPRF=I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.

Issuers provide a Private and Public Key, denoted `skI` and `pkI` respectively,
used to produce tokens as input to the protocol. See {{issuer-configuration}}
for how this key pair is generated.

Clients provide the following as input to the issuance protocol:

- Issuer Request URI: A URI to which token request messages are sent. This can
  be a URL derived from the "issuer-request-uri" value in the Issuer's
  directory resource, or it can be another Client-configured URL. The value
  of this parameter depends on the Client configuration and deployment model.
  For example, in the 'Joint Origin and Issuer' deployment model, the Issuer
  Request URI might be correspond to the Client's configured Attester, and the
  Attester is configured to relay requests to the Issuer.
- Issuer name: An identifier for the Issuer. This is typically a host name that
  can be used to construct HTTP requests to the Issuer.
- Issuer Public Key: `pkI`, with a key identifier `token_key_id` computed as
  described in {{issuer-configuration}}.
- Challenge value: `challenge`, an opaque byte string. For example, this might
  be provided by the redemption protocol in {{AUTHSCHEME}}.

Given this configuration and these inputs, the two messages exchanged in
this protocol are described below. This section uses notation described in
{{OPRF, Section 4}}, including SerializeElement and DeserializeElement,
SerializeScalar and DeserializeScalar, and DeriveKeyPair.

The constants `Ne` and `Ns` are as defined in {{OPRF, Section 4}} for
OPRF(P-384, SHA-384). The constant `Nk` is defined by {{private-token-type}}.

## Client-to-Issuer Request {#private-request}

The Client first creates a context as follows:

~~~
client_context = SetupVOPRFClient(0x0004, pkI)
~~~

Here, 0x0004 is the two-octet identifier corresponding to the
OPRF(P-384, SHA-384) ciphersuite in {{OPRF}}. SetupVOPRFClient
is defined in {{OPRF, Section 3.2}}.

The Client then creates an issuance request message for a random value `nonce`
with the input challenge and Issuer key identifier as described below:

~~~
nonce = random(32)
challenge_digest = SHA256(challenge)
token_input = concat(0x0001, // Token type field is 2 bytes long
                     nonce,
                     challenge_digest,
                     token_key_id)
blind, blinded_element = client_context.Blind(token_input)
~~~

The Blind function is defined in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}.
If the Blind function fails, the Client aborts the protocol.
The Client stores the `nonce` and `challenge_digest` values locally
for use when finalizing the issuance protocol to produce a token
(as described in {{private-finalize}}).

The Client then creates a TokenRequest structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint16_t token_type = 0x0001; /* Type VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384) */
  uint8_t truncated_token_key_id;
  uint8_t blinded_msg[Ne];
} TokenRequest;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, which matches the type in the challenge.

- "truncated_token_key_id" is the least significant byte of the `token_key_id`
  ({{issuer-configuration}}) in network byte order (in other words, the last 8
  bits of `token_key_id`).

- "blinded_msg" is the Ne-octet blinded message defined above, computed as
  `SerializeElement(blinded_element)`.

The values `token_input` and `blinded_element` are stored locally and used
later as described in {{private-finalize}}. The Client then generates an HTTP
POST request to send to the Issuer Request URI, with the TokenRequest as the
content. The media type for this request is
"application/private-token-request". An example request is shown below.

~~~
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = issuer.example.net
:path = /request
accept = application/private-token-response
cache-control = no-cache, no-store
content-type = application/private-token-request
content-length = <Length of TokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the TokenRequest>
~~~

## Issuer-to-Client Response {#private-response}

Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The TokenRequest contains a supported token_type.
- The TokenRequest.truncated_token_key_id corresponds to the truncated key ID
  of a Public Key owned by the issuer.
- The TokenRequest.blinded_msg is of the correct size.

If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 400 error
to the client. The Issuer then tries to deseralize
TokenRequest.blinded_msg using DeserializeElement from {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}},
yielding `blinded_element`. If this fails, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 400
error to the client. Otherwise, if the Issuer is willing to produce a token to
the Client, the Issuer completes the issuance flow by computing a blinded
response as follows:

~~~
server_context = SetupVOPRFServer(0x0004, skI, pkI)
evaluate_element, proof =
  server_context.Evaluate(skI, blinded_element)
~~~

SetupVOPRFServer is in {{OPRF, Section 3.2}} and Evaluate is defined in
{{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}. The Issuer then creates a TokenResponse structured
as follows:

~~~
struct {
   uint8_t evaluate_msg[Ne];
   uint8_t evaluate_proof[Ns+Ns];
} TokenResponse;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "evaluate_msg" is the Ne-octet evaluated message, computed as
  `SerializeElement(evaluate_element)`.

- "evaluate_proof" is the (Ns+Ns)-octet serialized proof, which is a pair of
  Scalar values, computed as
  `concat(SerializeScalar(proof[0]), SerializeScalar(proof[1]))`.

The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose content
consists of TokenResponse, with the content type set as
"application/private-token-response".

~~~
:status = 200
content-type = application/private-token-response
content-length = <Length of TokenResponse>

<Bytes containing the TokenResponse>
~~~

## Finalization {#private-finalize}

Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful, deserializes
the content values TokenResponse.evaluate_msg and TokenResponse.evaluate_proof,
yielding `evaluated_element` and `proof`. If deserialization of either value
fails, the Client aborts the protocol. Otherwise, the Client processes the
response as follows:

~~~
authenticator = client_context.Finalize(token_input, blind,
                                        evaluated_element,
                                        blinded_element,
                                        proof)
~~~

The Finalize function is defined in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.2}}. If this
succeeds, the Client then constructs a Token as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint16_t token_type = 0x0001; /* Type VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384) */
  uint8_t nonce[32];
  uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
  uint8_t token_key_id[32];
  uint8_t authenticator[Nk];
} Token;
~~~

The Token.nonce value is that which was sampled in {{private-request}}.
If the Finalize function fails, the Client aborts the protocol.

## Token Verification

Verifying a Token requires creating a VOPRF context using the Issuer Private
Key and Public Key, evaluating the token contents, and comparing the result
against the token authenticator value:

~~~
server_context = SetupVOPRFServer(0x0004, skI, pkI)
token_authenticator_input =
  concat(Token.token_type,
         Token.nonce,
         Token.challenge_digest,
         Token.token_key_id)
token_authenticator =
  server_context.Evaluate(token_authenticator_input)
valid = (token_authenticator == Token.authenticator)
~~~

## Issuer Configuration

Issuers are configured with Private and Public Key pairs, each denoted `skI`
and `pkI`, respectively, used to produce tokens. These keys MUST NOT be reused
in other protocols. A RECOMMENDED method for generating key pairs is as
follows:

~~~
seed = random(Ns)
(skI, pkI) = DeriveKeyPair(seed, "PrivacyPass")
~~~

The key identifier for a public key `pkI`, denoted `token_key_id`, is computed
as follows:

~~~
token_key_id = SHA256(SerializeElement(pkI))
~~~

Since Clients truncate `token_key_id` in each `TokenRequest`, Issuers should
ensure that the truncated form of new key IDs do not collide with other
truncated key IDs in rotation.

# Issuance Protocol for Publicly Verifiable Tokens {#public-flow}

This section describes a variant of the issuance protocol in {{private-flow}}
for producing publicly verifiable tokens using the protocol in {{BLINDRSA}}.
In particular, this variant of the issuance protocol works for the
RSABSSA-SHA384-PSS-Deterministic and RSABSSA-SHA384-PSSZERO-Deterministic
blind RSA protocol variants described in {{Section 5 of BLINDRSA}}.

The publicly verifiable issuance protocol differs from the protocol in
{{private-flow}} in that the output tokens are publicly verifiable by anyone
with the Issuer Public Key. This means any Origin can select a given Issuer to
produce tokens, as long as the Origin has the Issuer public key, without
explicit coordination or permission from the Issuer. This is because the Issuer
does not learn the Origin that requested the token during the issuance protocol.

Beyond this difference, the publicly verifiable issuance protocol variant is
nearly identical to the privately verifiable issuance protocol variant. In
particular, Issuers provide a Private and Public Key, denoted skI and pkI,
respectively, used to produce tokens as input to the protocol. See
{{public-issuer-configuration}} for how this key pair is generated.

Clients provide the following as input to the issuance protocol:

- Issuer Request URI: A URI to which token request messages are sent. This can
  be a URL derived from the "issuer-request-uri" value in the Issuer's
  directory resource, or it can be another Client-configured URL. The value
  of this parameter depends on the Client configuration and deployment model.
  For example, in the 'Split Origin, Attester, Issuer' deployment model, the
  Issuer Request URI might be correspond to the Client's configured Attester,
  and the Attester is configured to relay requests to the Issuer.
- Issuer name: An identifier for the Issuer. This is typically a host name that
  can be used to construct HTTP requests to the Issuer.
- Issuer Public Key: `pkI`, with a key identifier `token_key_id` computed as
  described in {{public-issuer-configuration}}.
- Challenge value: `challenge`, an opaque byte string. For example, this might
  be provided by the redemption protocol in {{AUTHSCHEME}}.

Given this configuration and these inputs, the two messages exchanged in
this protocol are described below. The constant `Nk` is defined by
{{public-token-type}}.

## Client-to-Issuer Request {#public-request}

The Client first creates an issuance request message for a random value
`nonce` using the input challenge and Issuer key identifier as follows:

~~~
nonce = random(32)
challenge_digest = SHA256(challenge)
token_input = concat(0x0002, // Token type field is 2 bytes long
                     nonce,
                     challenge_digest,
                     token_key_id)
blinded_msg, blind_inv =
  Blind(pkI, PrepareIdentity(token_input))
~~~

The PrepareIdentity and Blind functions are defined in
{{Section 4.1 of BLINDRSA}} and {{Section 4.2 of BLINDRSA}}, respectively.
The Client stores the nonce and challenge_digest values locally for use
when finalizing the issuance protocol to produce a token (as described
in {{public-finalize}}).

The Client then creates a TokenRequest structured as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint16_t token_type = 0x0002; /* Type Blind RSA (2048-bit) */
  uint8_t truncated_token_key_id;
  uint8_t blinded_msg[Nk];
} TokenRequest;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, which matches the type in the challenge.

- "truncated_token_key_id" is the least significant byte of the `token_key_id`
  ({{public-issuer-configuration}}) in network byte order (in other words, the
  last 8 bits of `token_key_id`).

- "blinded_msg" is the Nk-octet request defined above.

The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer Request
URI, with the TokenRequest as the content. The media type for this request
is "application/private-token-request". An example request is shown below:

~~~
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = issuer.example.net
:path = /request
accept = application/private-token-response
cache-control = no-cache, no-store
content-type = application/private-token-request
content-length = <Length of TokenRequest>

<Bytes containing the TokenRequest>
~~~

## Issuer-to-Client Response {#public-response}

Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following conditions:

- The TokenRequest contains a supported token_type.
- The TokenRequest.truncated_token_key_id corresponds to the truncated key
  ID of an Issuer Public Key.
- The TokenRequest.blinded_msg is of the correct size.

If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 400 error
to the Client, which will forward the error to the client. Otherwise, if the
Issuer is willing to produce a token token to the Client, the Issuer
completes the issuance flow by computing a blinded response as follows:

~~~
blind_sig = BlindSign(skI, TokenRequest.blinded_msg)
~~~

The BlindSign function is defined in {{Section 4.3 of BLINDRSA}}.
The result is encoded and transmitted to the client in the following
TokenResponse structure:

~~~
struct {
  uint8_t blind_sig[Nk];
} TokenResponse;
~~~

The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose content
consists of TokenResponse, with the content type set as
"application/private-token-response".

~~~
:status = 200
content-type = application/private-token-response
content-length = <Length of TokenResponse>

<Bytes containing the TokenResponse>
~~~

## Finalization {#public-finalize}

Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful, processes the
content as follows:

~~~
authenticator =
  Finalize(pkI, nonce, blind_sig, blind_inv)
~~~

The Finalize function is defined in {{Section 4.4 of BLINDRSA}}. If this
succeeds, the Client then constructs a Token as described in {{AUTHSCHEME}} as
follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint16_t token_type = 0x0002; /* Type Blind RSA (2048-bit) */
  uint8_t nonce[32];
  uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
  uint8_t token_key_id[32];
  uint8_t authenticator[Nk];
} Token;
~~~

The Token.nonce value is that which was sampled in {{private-request}}.
If the Finalize function fails, the Client aborts the protocol.

## Token Verification

Verifying a Token requires checking that Token.authenticator is a valid
signature over the remainder of the token input using the Issuer Public Key.
The function `RSASSA-PSS-VERIFY` is defined in {{Section 8.1.2 of !RFC8017}},
using SHA-384 as the Hash function, MGF1 with SHA-384 as the PSS mask
generation function (MGF), and a 48-byte salt length (sLen).

~~~
token_authenticator_input =
  concat(Token.token_type,
         Token.nonce,
         Token.challenge_digest,
         Token.token_key_id)
valid = RSASSA-PSS-VERIFY(pkI,
                          token_authenticator_input,
                          Token.authenticator)
~~~

## Issuer Configuration {#public-issuer-configuration}

Issuers are configured with Private and Public Key pairs, each denoted skI and
pkI, respectively, used to produce tokens. Each key pair SHALL be generated as
as specified in FIPS 186-4 {{?DSS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.186-4}}. These key
pairs MUST NOT be reused in other protocols.

The key identifier for a keypair (skI, pkI), denoted `token_key_id`, is
computed as SHA256(encoded_key), where encoded_key is a DER-encoded
SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) object carrying pkI. The SPKI object MUST use the
RSASSA-PSS OID {{!RFC5756}}, which specifies the hash algorithm and salt size.
The salt size MUST match the output size of the hash function associated with
the public key and token type.

Since Clients truncate `token_key_id` in each `TokenRequest`, Issuers should
ensure that the truncated form of new key IDs do not collide with other
truncated key IDs in rotation.

# Security considerations

This document outlines how to instantiate the Issuance protocol
based on the VOPRF defined in {{OPRF}} and blind RSA protocol defined in
{{BLINDRSA}}. All security considerations described in the VOPRF and blind RSA
documents also apply in the Privacy Pass use-case. Considerations related to
broader privacy and security concerns in a multi-Client and multi-Issuer
setting are deferred to the Architecture document {{ARCHITECTURE}}. In
particular, the privacy considerations in
{{Section 4 and Section 5 of ARCHITECTURE}}, particularly those pertaining to
Issuer Public Key rotation and consistency (where consistency is as described
in {{?CONSISTENCY=I-D.privacypass-key-consistency}}) and Issuer selection, are
relevant for implementations of the protocols in this document.

# Test Vectors

This section includes test vectors for the two basic issuance protocols
specified in this document. {{test-vectors-poprf}} contains test vectors
for token issuance protocol 1 (0x0001), and {{test-vectors-rsa}} contains
test vectors for token issuance protocol 2 (0x0002).

## Issuance Protocol 1 - VOPRF(P-384, SHA-384) {#test-vectors-poprf}

The test vector below lists the following values:

- skS: The Issuer private Key, serialized using SerializeScalar from
  {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}} and represented as a hexadecimal string.
- pkS: The Issuer Public Key, serialized using SerializeElement from
  {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}} and represented as a hexadecimal string.
- token_challenge: A randomly generated TokenChallenge structure, represented
  as a hexadecimal string.
- nonce: The 32-byte client nonce generated according to {{private-request}},
  represented as a hexadecimal string.
- blind: The blind used when computing the OPRF blinded message, serialized
  using SerializeScalar from {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}} and represented as a
  hexadecimal string.
- token_request: The TokenRequest message constructed according to
  {{private-request}}, represented as a hexadecimal string.
- token_response: The TokenResponse message constructed according to
  {{private-response}}, represented as a hexadecimal string.
- token: The output Token from the protocol, represented as a hexadecimal
  string.
